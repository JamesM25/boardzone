## Project Description
I aim to create a web application where the user may play a variety of board games against an AI opponent,
or against other players.

As of the time of writing, I intend to implement checkers over the coming months, using the
[minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to implement AI opponents.

Moves by AI opponents will be chosen on the backend, and communicated to the frontend via a web API.
